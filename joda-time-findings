Initially Ekstazi runs, 4067 tests on joda-time commit version f36072e1. I could find 4063 methods with signature "public void test*" in all test files. I used the command grep -rnw . -e "public void" | wc -l and then subtracted the lines containing "//". So Ekstazi is expected to run these many tests.

The issue is that even after making no changes, Ekstazi runs 2 tests in TestAllPackages in the second run.
