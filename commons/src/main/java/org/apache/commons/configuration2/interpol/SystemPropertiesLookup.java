/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized implementation of the {@code Lookup} interface that allows
 * access to system properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation relies on {@code StrLookup.systemPropertiesLookup()} from
 * the Commons Lang project to resolve system properties. It can be used for
 * referencing system properties in configuration files in an easy way, for
 * instance:
 *
 * <pre>
 * current.user = ${sys:user.name}
 * </pre>
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code SystemPropertiesLookup} is one of the standard lookups that is
 * registered per default for each configuration.
