     * returned configuration the sub tree can directly be accessed, it becomes
     * the root node of this configuration. Because of this the passed in key
     * must select exactly one configuration node; otherwise an
     * {@code IllegalArgumentException} will be thrown.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The difference between this method and the
     * {@link #subset(String)} method is that
     * {@code subset()} supports arbitrary subsets of configuration nodes
     * while {@code configurationAt()} only returns a single sub tree.
     * Please refer to the documentation of the
     * {@code SubnodeConfiguration} class to obtain further information
     * about subnode configurations and when they should be used.

     * <p>
     * With the {@code supportUpdate} flag the behavior of the returned
     * {@code SubnodeConfiguration} regarding updates of its parent
     * configuration can be determined. A subnode configuration operates on the
     * same nodes as its parent, so changes at one configuration are normally
     * directly visible for the other configuration. There are however changes
     * of the parent configuration, which are not recognized by the subnode
     * configuration per default. An example for this is a reload operation (for
     * file-based configurations): Here the complete node set of the parent
     * configuration is replaced, but the subnode configuration still references
     * the old nodes. If such changes should be detected by the subnode
     * configuration, the {@code supportUpdates} flag must be set to
     * <b>true</b>. This causes the subnode configuration to reevaluate the key
     * used for its creation each time it is accessed. This guarantees that the
     * subnode configuration always stays in sync with its key, even if the
     * parent configuration's data significantly changes. If such a change
     * makes the key invalid - because it now no longer points to exactly one
     * node -, the subnode configuration is not reconstructed, but keeps its
     * old data. It is then quasi detached from its parent.
