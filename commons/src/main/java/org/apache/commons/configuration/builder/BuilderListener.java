/**

 * A listener interface for receiving notifications when the status of a
 * {@link ConfigurationBuilder} is changed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are use cases when it is of interest to monitor the status of a
 * {@code ConfigurationBuilder}. Especially, if the builder creates new result
 * objects dynamically, it may be important to know when it was reset because it
 * will then return a new result object. This could also mean that the
 * {@code Configuration} object managed by the builder has changed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface defines a single method which gets called when the builder was
 * reset. A concrete implementation could react on this notification for
 * instance by querying a new result object or by marking a reference to the
 * current {@code Configuration} as stale.
